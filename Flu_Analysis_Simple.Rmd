This is part of an analysis exercise I did in a Modern Applied data analysis course at UGA with Dr. Andreas Handel. We used data on flu patients You can find the full steps to data cleaning on more information [here at the github page](https://github.com/nicholasmallis/NicholasMallis-MADA-analysis3)

###Data Loading 
```{r}
#loads needed packages.
library(ggplot2) #for plotting
library(broom) #for cleaning up output from lm()
library(here) #for data loading/saving
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

#path to data
#note the use of the here() package and not absolute paths
data_location <- here::here("files", "processeddata.rds")

#load data. 
mydata <- readRDS(data_location)

```

##Linear Models
```{r}
library(tidymodels)  # for the parsnip package, along with the rest of tidymodels

# Helper packages
library(readr)       # for importing data
library(broom.mixed) # for converting bayesian models to tidy tibbles
library(dotwhisker)  # for visualizing regression results



#setting engine
lm_mod <- 
  linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm")

#running model
lm_fit <- 
  lm_mod %>% 
  fit(BodyTemp ~ RunnyNose, data = mydata)
lm_fit

#saving as table
lm_fit_table <- tidy(lm_fit)

#saved it as a file
summarytable_file2 = here("files", "lm_fit_table.rds")
saveRDS(lm_fit_table, file = summarytable_file2)

#using glance to get statistics
lm_fit_stats <- glance(lm_fit)


#saved it as a file
summarytable_file3 = here("files", "lm_fit_stats.rds")
saveRDS(lm_fit_stats, file = summarytable_file3)


```

Now I  display the saved file for an improved aesthetic. 
```{r summarytable,  echo=FALSE, }
resulttable=readRDS("/Users/nicholasmallis/Desktop/MADA_Fall_2021/NicholasMallis-MADA-portfolio/files/lm_fit_table.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Coefficients from Simple Linear Regression Model with Body Temperature as the outcome and Runny Nose as the predictor')
```


Now I  display the saved file for an improved aesthetic. 
```{r summarytable3,  echo=FALSE, }

resulttable=readRDS("/Users/nicholasmallis/Desktop/MADA_Fall_2021/NicholasMallis-MADA-portfolio/files/lm_fit_stats.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Simple Linear Regression Model with Body Temperature as the outcome and Runny Nose as the predictor')
```




Fits another linear model to the continuous outcome using all (important) predictors of interest.
```{r}

#same thing this time, but for multivariable
lm_mod2 <- 
  linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm")

lm_fit2 <- 
  lm_mod2 %>% 
  fit(BodyTemp ~  .-SwollenLymphNodes - Wheeze, data = mydata)
lm_fit2

#saving table of all coefficients
lm_fit_full_table <- tidy(lm_fit2)

#saved it as a file
summarytable_file4 = here("files", "lm_fit_full_table.rds")
saveRDS(lm_fit_full_table, file = summarytable_file4)

#using glance to get statistics
lm_fit_full_stats <- glance(lm_fit2)

#saved it as a file
summarytable_file5 = here("files", "lm_fit_full_stats.rds")
saveRDS(lm_fit_full_stats, file = summarytable_file5)

```



Now I  display the saved file for an improved aesthetic. 
```{r summarytable4,  echo=FALSE, }

resulttable=readRDS("/Users/nicholasmallis/Desktop/MADA_Fall_2021/NicholasMallis-MADA-portfolio/files/lm_fit_full_table.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Coefficients from Multivariate Linear Regression Model with Body Temperature as the outcome and Runny Nose and all other covariates as the predictors')
```


Now I  display the saved file for an improved aesthetic. 
```{r summarytable5,  echo=FALSE, }

resulttable=readRDS("/Users/nicholasmallis/Desktop/MADA_Fall_2021/NicholasMallis-MADA-portfolio/files/log_fit_full_stats.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Multivariate Linear Regression Model with Body Temperature as the outcome and Runny Nose and all other covariates as the predictors')
```


#Comparing both linear models:
Here I use ANOVA to test whether the more complex model is significantly better at capturing the data than the simpler model. The resulting p-value is sufficiently low so we conclude that the more complex model is significantly better than the simpler model. Also, from the glance() output prior, we see that the AIC for the multivariate model is lower that the simple model.

```{r}

comparing_lm_anova <- anova(lm_fit$fit, lm_fit2$fit)

tidy(anova(lm_fit$fit, lm_fit2$fit))

summarytable_file6 = here("files", "comparing_lm_anova.rds")
saveRDS(comparing_lm_anova, file = summarytable_file6)
```

Now I  display the saved file for an improved aesthetic. 
```{r summarytable6,  echo=FALSE, }

resulttable=readRDS("/Users/nicholasmallis/Desktop/MADA_Fall_2021/NicholasMallis-MADA-portfolio/files/comparing_lm_anova.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'ANOVA Table Comparing the Simple and Complex Models')
```


###Logistic Models
Fits a logistic model to the categorical outcome using only the main predictor of interest.

```{r}

#setting engine
log_mod <- 
  logistic_reg()  %>% 
  set_engine("glm")

log_fit <- 
  log_mod %>% 
  fit(Nausea ~ RunnyNose , data = mydata)
log_fit

#saving coeffiecents in a table
log_fit_table <- tidy(log_fit)

#save as a table object in resutls 
summarytable_file7 = here("files", "log_fit_table.rds")
saveRDS(log_fit_table, file = summarytable_file7)

#glancing at stats
log_fit_stats <- glance(log_fit)

#saving
summarytable_file8 = here("files", "log_fit_stats.rds")
saveRDS(log_fit_stats, file = summarytable_file8)

```


```{r summarytable7,  echo=FALSE, }

resulttable=readRDS("/Users/nicholasmallis/Desktop/MADA_Fall_2021/NicholasMallis-MADA-portfolio/files/log_fit_table.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Simple Logistic Model with Runny Nose as the Predictor and Nausea as the Outcome')
```


```{r summarytable8,  echo=FALSE, }

resulttable=readRDS("/Users/nicholasmallis/Desktop/MADA_Fall_2021/NicholasMallis-MADA-portfolio/files/log_fit_stats.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Simple Logistic Model with Runny Nose as the Predictor and Nausea as the Outcome')
```

Fits another logistic model to the categorical outcome using all (important) predictors of interest. Compares the model results for the categorical model with just the main predictor and all predictors. 

```{r}
#same here but for multivariable model
log_mod2 <- 
  logistic_reg()  %>% 
  set_engine("glm")

log_fit2 <- 
  log_mod2 %>% 
  fit(Nausea ~  .-SwollenLymphNodes - Wheeze, data = mydata)
log_fit2

log_fit_full_table <- tidy(log_fit2)

summarytable_file9 = here("files", "log_fit_full_table.rds")
saveRDS(log_fit_full_table, file = summarytable_file9)

log_fit_full_stats <- glance(log_fit2)

summarytable_file10 = here("files", "log_fit_full_stats.rds")
saveRDS(log_fit_full_stats, file = summarytable_file10)




```

```{r summarytable9,  echo=FALSE, }

resulttable=readRDS("/Users/nicholasmallis/Desktop/MADA_Fall_2021/NicholasMallis-MADA-portfolio/files/log_fit_full_table.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Multivariate Logistic Model with Runny Nose and other Covariates as the Predictors and Nausea as the Outcome')
```


```{r summarytable10,  echo=FALSE, }

resulttable=readRDS("/Users/nicholasmallis/Desktop/MADA_Fall_2021/NicholasMallis-MADA-portfolio/files/log_fit_full_stats.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Multivariate Logistic Model with Runny Nose and other Covariates as the Predictors and Nausea as the Outcome')
```


#Comparing both logistic models:
Due to the high scaled deviance 189.73, we conclude that the model with all predictors is significantly better at capturing the data than the simpler model. Also, from the glance() output prior, we see that the AIC for the multivariate model is lower that the simple model.
```{r}
#using anova to compare both the complex and simple
anova_log <- anova(log_fit$fit, log_fit2$fit)

#saving as table
summarytable_file11 = here("files", "anova_log.rds")
saveRDS(anova_log, file = summarytable_file11)

```


```{r summarytable11,  echo=FALSE, }

resulttable=readRDS("/Users/nicholasmallis/Desktop/MADA_Fall_2021/NicholasMallis-MADA-portfolio/files/anova_log.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Comparing the Simple and Complex Models')
```
