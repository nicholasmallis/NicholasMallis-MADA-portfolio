Hello! I am a third yeard PhD student at UGA studying Epidemiology & Biostatistics with an emphasis in data analysis. I have worked on a wide range of research and community health projects focusing on influenza vaccination efficacy, preeclampsia, school-based health centers, antibiotic resistance, and more recently vaping and COVID-19. My disseratation will be examining the relationship between organophosphates and birth outcomes using data from the PROTECT cohort study.


In 2020, I worked with faculty members and other students to make models that predicted COVID case counts, hospitalizations, and deaths in the Northeast Georgia region. The report was presented to local hospitals and government officials. [You can see the whole report here](http://publichealth.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19_-ACC-Health-Service-Area-Modeling-Report_FINAL.pdf.), but I'm guessing you've seen enough infectious disease models to last a lifetime so I understand if you pass. I also worked for the Georgia Department of Public Health as a case investigator, but stopped working for them back in the spring.

### R Experience and Goals

* I have been using R and SAS for about 4 years and worked as an analyst on several projects. 
* With this class, I  hope to learn a ton of new tricks and tactics for data analytics and improve my overall workflow. 
* I am particulary interested in getting more experience with github and R Markdown.




### Something Non-Academic
One interesting fact about me is that I live a double life as an indie pop musician. Coming from a non statistics background, some days I feel like a performer pretending to be grad student, but other days it feels like the other way around.

### A New Friend
My wife and I just got a new kitten and her name is Salty Jim. She looks sweet here, but most days she's trying to kill me.

### A Funny Video 
I just came across a song/video about the battle between statisticians and data scientists. Below is a screenshot from it. I think you will enjoy it if you have a minute.  [You can watch the full video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGlCi9jOWY).
